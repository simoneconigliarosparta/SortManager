# SortManager

The Sort Manager allows the user to select 6 different algorithms to sort an array via the command line:

-	Bubble Sort
-	Merge Sort
-	Binary Tree Sort
-	Quick Sort
-	Insertion Sort
-	Selection Sort
	
The program will ask the user to select the length of an array.

Only for the Binary Tree Sort, the user will be able to select the root element of the tree.

A random array will be generated and it will be sorted using the algorithm previously chosen.

The program will output the name of the algorithm selected, the randomly generated array before and after being sorted and the time taken for the algorithm to complete the task.

The functionality of the program and performance of the algorithms have been tested with JUnit5.

The project has been structured following the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.

A Logger has been implemented to keep track of the flow of the Sort Manager.

Constraints:
Max length of an array must be 1000.
All values of an array must be between -1000 and 1000 (ends of the range included).
